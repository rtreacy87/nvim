# Treesitter in Neovim - Wiki Series

Welcome to the Treesitter in Neovim wiki series! This collection of guides will help you understand, set up, and effectively use Treesitter to enhance your Neovim experience.

## About Treesitter

Treesitter is a parsing system that provides accurate syntax highlighting, indentation, and code navigation capabilities for multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional regex-based highlighting, Treesitter builds a concrete syntax tree of your code, enabling more accurate and context-aware features.
