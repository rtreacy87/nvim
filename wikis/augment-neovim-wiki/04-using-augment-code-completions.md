# Leveraging AI-Powered Code Completions in Your Workflow

Now that you've set up Augment Code and configured your workspace context, it's time to learn how to use the AI-powered code completions effectively. This guide will show you how to get the most out of Augment's suggestions in your daily coding.

## Basic Usage

### How Completions Appear

When you start typing in Neovim with Augment Code enabled:

1. **Ghost Text**: As you type, you'll see faded "ghost text" appearing ahead of your cursor. This is Augment's suggestion for completing your current line or block of code.

2. **Context-Aware**: These suggestions are based on your codebase, not just the current file. Augment analyzes patterns in your code to suggest completions that match your style and project structure.

3. **Multi-Line Suggestions**: Sometimes Augment will suggest multiple lines of code, such as entire function bodies or code blocks.

### Accepting Suggestions

By default, you can accept suggestions using the Tab key:

1. **Accepting the Entire Suggestion**: Press `Tab` to accept the entire suggestion
2. **Accepting Part of a Suggestion**: Continue typing to narrow down the suggestion, then press `Tab` to accept what's shown
3. **Ignoring a Suggestion**: Simply keep typing to ignore the suggestion

### Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow:

1. Start typing a function:
   ```python
   def calculate_total_price(items, 
   ```

2. Augment might suggest:
   ```python
   discount_rate=0.0):
       total = sum(item.price for item in items)
       return total * (1 - discount_rate)
   ```

3. Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion and continue coding

## Customizing Completion Behavior

### Changing the Accept Key

If you prefer to use a different key to accept suggestions:

For Neovim with Lua (in your `init.lua`):
```lua
-- Use Ctrl-Y to accept a suggestion
vim.keymap.set('i', '<C-y>', '<cmd>call augment#Accept()<cr>')
```

For Vim with Vimscript (in your `.vimrc`):
```vim
" Use Ctrl-Y to accept a suggestion
inoremap <C-y> <cmd>call augment#Accept()<cr>
```

### Using Enter to Accept Suggestions

You can also configure Enter to accept suggestions, falling back to a normal newline if no suggestion is available:

```lua
-- Use Enter to accept suggestions
vim.keymap.set('i', '<CR>', '<cmd>call augment#Accept("\\n")<cr>')
```

### Disabling the Default Tab Mapping

If you want to use Tab for other purposes, you can disable Augment's Tab mapping:

```lua
-- Add this BEFORE loading the plugin
vim.g.augment_disable_tab_mapping = true
```

### Enabling/Disabling Completions Globally

You can toggle completions on and off using these commands:

- `:Augment enable` - Turn on completions
- `:Augment disable` - Turn off completions

This is useful when you want to temporarily disable suggestions without uninstalling the plugin.

## Optimizing for Your Coding Style

### Getting More Relevant Suggestions

To improve the quality of suggestions:

1. **Use Augment More**: The more you use Augment, the better it understands your coding patterns

2. **Include Relevant Context**: Make sure your workspace folders include all the code that's relevant to what you're working on

3. **Write Clear Code**: Augment works best when your existing code follows consistent patterns

### Working with Completions in Different Languages

Augment Code works with many programming languages. Here are some tips for specific languages:

**Python**:
- Start typing function definitions with docstrings to get complete function suggestions
- When working with classes, define the class and then start typing method names

**JavaScript/TypeScript**:
- Start typing import statements to get suggestions for modules
- Begin function definitions with proper types for better completion

**Other Languages**:
- The same principles apply: start with clear, structured code
- Make sure you have enough context in your workspace folders

### Balancing with Other Completion Plugins

If you use other completion plugins like nvim-cmp:

1. **Consider Key Mappings**: Make sure Augment's accept key doesn't conflict with other plugins

2. **Priority**: Decide which completion source you want to prioritize

3. **Selective Enabling**: You might want to enable Augment only for certain file types

Example configuration for using Augment with nvim-cmp:
```lua
-- Disable Augment's Tab mapping if you're using nvim-cmp with Tab
vim.g.augment_disable_tab_mapping = true

-- Then set up a custom mapping for Augment
vim.keymap.set('i', '<C-a>', '<cmd>call augment#Accept()<cr>')
```

## Tips for Effective Use

### When to Accept Suggestions

- **Accept When Confident**: If the suggestion matches what you were about to type, accept it
- **Keep Typing When Unsure**: If you're not sure about a suggestion, keep typing to refine it
- **Check Multi-Line Suggestions**: For longer suggestions, take a moment to review before accepting

### Learning from Suggestions

Augment Code can actually help you learn:

- Pay attention to patterns in the suggestions
- Notice how it completes functions or implements patterns
- Use it to discover better ways to structure your code

### Keyboard Efficiency

To work efficiently with Augment:

1. Get comfortable with the accept key (Tab by default)
2. Practice typing a few characters and then accepting suggestions
3. For longer suggestions, scan them quickly before accepting
