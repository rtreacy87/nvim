# Building a Local AI Coding Assistant - Wiki Series

Welcome to the Local AI Coding Assistant wiki series! This collection of guides will help you build a privacy-focused AI coding assistant that runs entirely on your local machine, similar to commercial solutions like Augment Code but with complete control over your data.

## About This Project

This project creates a local AI coding assistant with features similar to commercial solutions like Augment Code, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor AI. The system provides:

- Context-aware code completions
- Interactive chat for code understanding
- Codebase-wide search and understanding
- Integration with Neovim

All functionality runs locally, ensuring your code never leaves your machine.

## Wiki Guides

This series consists of five focused guides:

1. [**Introduction to Local AI Coding Assistants**](01-introduction-to-local-ai-assistants.md)
   - Understanding AI coding assistants
   - Benefits of local vs. cloud solutions
   - Hardware and software requirements

2. [**Setting Up Ollama and Local LLMs**](02-setting-up-ollama-and-llms.md)
   - Installing and configuring Ollama
   - Selecting code-focused LLMs
   - Testing and optimizing models

3. [**Building a Code Understanding System**](03-building-code-understanding.md)
   - Creating a code indexing system
   - Implementing a RAG pipeline
   - Optimizing for code-specific challenges

4. [**Neovim Integration**](04-neovim-integration.md)
   - Creating a Neovim plugin
   - Implementing completions and chat
   - Setting up keybindings

5. [**Advanced Features and Optimization**](05-advanced-features.md)
   - Performance optimization
   - Adding semantic code navigation
   - Extending the system

## Who These Guides Are For

These guides are designed for:

- Developers who want AI assistance without relying on cloud services
- Privacy-conscious programmers
- Neovim users looking to enhance their coding environment
- Anyone interested in understanding how AI coding assistants work

The guides assume basic familiarity with Neovim, Python, and general programming concepts.

## Hardware Recommendations

For the best experience with local LLMs:

- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor (8+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, 32GB+ recommended
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (for GPU acceleration)
- **Storage**: SSD with at least 50GB free space
