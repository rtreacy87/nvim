Here are several ways to copy the messages from :messages:

  Method 1: Redirect to Register

  :redir @a
  :messages
  :redir END
  :put a
  This copies messages to register a, then pastes them in your current
  buffer.

  Method 2: Save to File

  :redir > /tmp/nvim_messages.txt
  :messages
  :redir END
  Then open the file:
  cat /tmp/nvim_messages.txt

  Method 3: Use Telescope (if available)

  :Telescope vim_options
  " or
  :Telescope commands

  Method 4: One-liner to Clipboard

  :let @+ = execute(':messages')
  This copies directly to system clipboard (if clipboard is enabled).

  Method 5: Quick Copy-Paste

  :messages
  " In the messages window:
  " 1. Enter visual mode with 'v'
  " 2. Select the error text
  " 3. Copy with 'y'
  " 4. Paste elsewhere with 'p' or Ctrl+V

  Method 6: Echo and Copy

  :echo execute(':messages')
  This displays messages in a way you can select and copy.

  Easiest method: Try Method 1 (redirect to register) - it's the most
  reliable for getting all the message content you can then paste and share.
