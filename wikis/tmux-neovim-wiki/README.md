# Tmux-Neovim Integration - Wiki Series

Welcome to the Tmux-Neovim Integration wiki series! This collection of guides will help you create a powerful, integrated development environment by combining the terminal multiplexer tmux with the modern text editor Neovim.

## About Tmux-Neovim Integration

Tmux and Neovim form a powerful combination for developers who want to work efficiently in a terminal-based environment. This integration allows you to:

- Send code snippets from Neovim directly to terminal sessions
- Navigate terminal output using familiar vim motions
- Capture and analyze terminal output in files
- Create seamless workflows between editing and execution
- Manage multiple projects and sessions efficiently

This wiki series covers everything from basic setup to advanced workflows, providing you with the knowledge to create a highly productive development environment.

## Who These Guides Are For

These guides are designed for:

- Developers who want to maximize terminal-based productivity
- Neovim users looking to enhance their workflow with tmux
- Data scientists and researchers who work with REPLs
- Anyone interested in creating efficient development environments
- Users transitioning from IDE-based workflows to terminal-based ones
- Both beginners and experienced users of tmux and Neovim

The guides assume basic familiarity with both tmux and Neovim but explain concepts clearly for those with limited experience.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this series, you should have:

- Basic familiarity with Neovim (opening files, basic editing)
- Some experience with terminal/command line usage
- Understanding of basic programming concepts
- Willingness to experiment with configuration files

No prior tmux experience is required - we'll cover everything from the basics.

## Getting Started

Begin with the first guide, [Introduction to Tmux-Neovim Integration](01-introduction-to-tmux-neovim-integration.md), and work your way through the series in order. Each guide builds upon concepts from previous ones.

## Key Features Covered
